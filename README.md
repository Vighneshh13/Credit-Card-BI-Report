Steps involved in generating Power BI Credit Card Dashboard:
1. Download the CSV files: customer.csv and cc_details.csv. These files contain detailed information regarding customers of the credit card company as well as the credit card details.
2. Create a MySQL database to store the Customer and Credit Card details. Create separate tables to store Customer data and Credit Card data. Use MySQL's Data Import Wizard to import data from the aforementioned CSV files and populate the MySQL tables.
3. Create a new Power BI Blank Report. Click on Get Data -> Database -> MySQL database. Import the data from the MySQL database (Alternatively you may also import data directly from the csv file).
4. Perform necessary data cleaning and transformation operations if any.
5. In the PowerBI Report view, start generating visualizations to convey data insights. Ensure selecting suitable visualizations depending on the metrics and type of data being visualized. Publish the Report.
